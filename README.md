# sh-create-github-repo

Creates a repository on GitHub with the specified name and description. The created repository is then setup locally with a simple `README.md` and default `.gitignore`.

An example is my repository [automatically-generated-repo-2](https://github.com/nickramsay19/automatically-generated-repo-2) which was generated by this script. Ironically, so was this one ðŸ˜‚.

## Usage
```sh
git clone git@github.com:nickramsay19/sh-create-github-repo.git
cd sh-create-github-repo
touch .env
```

You then must create a `.env` follow with the following:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME="<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
export GITHUB_BEARER_TOKEN="<YOUR_GITHUB_API_TOKEN>
export GITHUB_DEFAULT_REPOSITORY_DESCRIPTION=""
export LICENSE_COPYRIGHT="<YOUR_FULL_LEGAL_NAME>"
```

Now you may run
```sh
sh create-github-repo.sh
```

You will need to enter you GitHub password.
